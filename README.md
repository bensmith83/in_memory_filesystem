implement an in-memory filesystem in python
## what
i heard recently about a coding challenge to implement an in-memory filesystem in python, and it sounded fun so I figured I had to give it a shot. This isn't efficient and uses strings for paths in some places and objects in others. it also iterates over the entire set of all nodes each time movemeng happens. That should change. Either way, the goal was just to make it work, and maybe I'll improve it later.
